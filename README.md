Data Set Link: https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/3/2/15/htm (There are 2 datasets; I used the Restaurant Dataset for training)

Trained an Embedding Layer with Bengali Words in CBOW style to make a neural network understand semantic-relationships between words in a sentence. 
Embedding Dimension = 64 DIMENSION, Vocabulary Size = 4863 bengali words.

Each word is projected on 64 dimentional vector space.
